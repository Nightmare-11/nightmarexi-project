# NightmareXI  
### Reverse Fantasy Cricket Platform  
**Pick flops. Score big. Win caps.**

🌐 **Web App:** https://www.nightmarexi.com  
📱 **Android App:** Closed Play Store testing  
🧑‍💻 **Developer:** Arshdeep Singh

## Overview

NightmareXI is a fantasy cricket platform that **reverses traditional fantasy sports logic**.

Instead of selecting star performers, users predict the **worst-performing players** in real matches.  
The worse a selected player performs, the **higher the user’s score**.

After every match, the platform reveals the official **NightmareXI** — the 11 worst performers of the game.

The platform is **100% free**, uses **virtual currency only**, and is designed as a **skill-based prediction game**, not gambling.

## How It Works

1. Choose an upcoming cricket match
2. Join a contest using virtual currency (“Caps”)
3. Select **11 players** expected to perform poorly
4. Scores update live as the match progresses
5. Leaderboards rank users by inverted performance
6. Post-match, the official **NightmareXI** is revealed
